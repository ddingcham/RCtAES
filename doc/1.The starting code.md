What's up with this code? 
You may not understand everything this code is doing, 
but you should be able to see that it mixes different concerns, 
which I've suggested by coloring the code example below.

The first thing for me to say here is that there isn't much code in this example. 
If the entire codebase is just this script, then you don't have to worry as much about modularity. 
I need a small example, but any reader's eyes would glaze over if we looked at a real system. 
So I have to ask you to imagine this code as typical code in a system of tens of thousands of lines.

  #### 내 기준에서는 위에를 하면서, 컴파일 가능한 상태로 만들어 놔야 될 듯  
  
#### separation of concerns  
> different topics should be in separate modules
